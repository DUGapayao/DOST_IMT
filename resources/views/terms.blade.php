                7.2 Users should be aware of the potential risks associated with interacting with individuals misrepresenting themselves. While System employs various verification techniques for user data during registration, it cannot verify every user's identity due to the inherent challenges of online verification.

            </p>

            <p>
                7.3 Users assume all risks associated with accessing or using the System and conducting transactions through them. They are solely responsible for any liability or harm arising from activities conducted through the System.

            </p>

            <h4>8. Limitation of Liability</h4>

            <p>
                8.1 The System shall not be liable for the correctness, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents given by the user.

            <p>

The System checked the contents of the external links during initial connection to ensure that there were no legal infractions. At that time, no infractions of applicable laws were evident. The present and future layout and content of the connected Systems are completely independent of the System. The System does not claim ownership of the material related to any external links or references, despite their inclusion. Continuous monitoring of potential infractions of applicable legislation is not thought to be appropriate in the absence of conclusive evidence of infringement. External links of that nature, however, will be immediately removed if such violations are discovered.

            <p>
